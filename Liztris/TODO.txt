  Menus - 
    
	choice can wrap
	choice that shows all options
	choice that shows 1 option with arrows on sides indicating more options

	set properties and selected indicies on game load (resolution, controls, etc)
	submenu options
		when opening submenu, have a default index that is selected
		[when opening submenu, do we want to have saved an index?]
			ie start new game, select 4 players, back, start new game
				do we show 4 players or 1 player?
			this is important if you quit a game and start a new game
			and want all the game options to be the same. Consider a
			battle mode where you are adding an extra player but still 
			want the other options to be the same...

		when opening submenu2, save index of that submenu in submenu1 
			so that when submenu2 is closed (back), the selected index
			in submenu1 is submenu2

		ensure that when a submenu is closed, the 'back'/close option
			is not saved - since there can be 2 ways to close menu
			(b / esc vs menu option)

	should be able to draw an action (apply, new game) different than
		a submenu (single right arrow indicating new menu will open?)
