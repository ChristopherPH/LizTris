 Misc Other backend things 
	[Mostly menu, player join and controller stuff, and key remapping]
	Menu sounds
	Remap keys, and save keyboard map
	Wait for players screen, so that pressing a controller becomes that player, or pressing keyboard becomes that one
	Game states (intro screen with animation, etc)
	menus should remember location, unless 'back (closemenu)' was selected
	menu should clear temp resolution settings when going back
	resoltion menu ask if everything is ok on apply changes, and revert back
		after a timer just in case
	be able to join in while playing
	Menu descriptions of selected item displayed at bottom of menu

	choose location on new player (left, right, middle, etc) when playing endless/challenge
		and someone joins
		 (right of 'Liz')
		 (left of 'Liz')
		 (between 'Liz and Gwen')

	More Menus stuff
    
		choice can wrap
		choice that shows all options
		choice that shows 1 option with arrows on sides indicating more options

		set properties and selected indicies on game load (resolution, controls, etc)
		submenu options
			when opening submenu, have a default index that is selected
			[when opening submenu, do we want to have saved an index?]
				ie start new game, select 4 players, back, start new game
					do we show 4 players or 1 player?
				this is important if you quit a game and start a new game
				and want all the game options to be the same. Consider a
				battle mode where you are adding an extra player but still 
				want the other options to be the same...

			when opening submenu2, save index of that submenu in submenu1 
				so that when submenu2 is closed (back), the selected index
				in submenu1 is submenu2

			ensure that when a submenu is closed, the 'back'/close option
				is not saved - since there can be 2 ways to close menu
				(b / esc vs menu option)

		should be able to draw an action (apply, new game) different than
			a submenu (single right arrow indicating new menu will open?)
